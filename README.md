## Project Description

LightFrame is a collaborative project undertaken by Omer Sezer and Georges Ouweijan. It consists of 32x32 grid of WS2812b (NeoPixel) LED Strips on a large wooden frame, overlayed by a pixel isolating grid and covered by a diffusion sheet. This creates a large LED screen which is used to display pixel art images, gifs, and videos. It can be controlled by a custom website that allows users to turn the screen on and off, control brightness, upload media files, and select which files should be played and for how long. 

## Features

- 32x32 Neopixel LED screen.
- Support for displaying PNG images, GIF animations, and MP4 videos.
- Optimized frame loading using worker threads.
- A REST API for remote control and media upload.
- User-friendly web interface for controlling brightness and screen power.
